TI  - Contralateral pneumothorax during retroperitoneal laparoscopic donor nephrectomy:
      A case report.
LID - 10.1111/ases.12354 [doi]
AB  - This report presents a case of a 46-year-old woman in whom contralateral
      pneumothorax occurred during retroperitoneal laparoscopic donor nephrectomy
      without any evidence of diaphragmatic injuries. After the start of carbon
      dioxide-induced pneumoperitoneum, the patient's end-tidal carbon dioxide pressure
      and heart rate suddenly increased. The surgery was then paused, and a chest X-ray
      revealed a right pneumothorax accompanied by pneumomediastinum. After a
      thoracostomy tube was inserted, these symptoms immediately improved. After
      conversion to an open procedure, the surgery was completed. The thoracostomy tube
      was removed the next day, and the patient was discharged without any
      complications. As the pneumothorax occurred on the opposite side to the operative
      field and there was no evidence of diaphragmatic injury, it is suspected to have 
      been caused by a pneumomediastinum-induced rupture of the barrier between the
      mediastinum and pleural space. This may have occurred due to the insufflated
      carbon dioxide gas passing directly into the mediastinum and then the pleural
      space.
