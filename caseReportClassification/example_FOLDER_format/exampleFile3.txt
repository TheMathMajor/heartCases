AB  - BACKGROUND Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is an acute inflammatory demyelinating
      polyneuropathy that is usually associated with preceding respiratory or
      gastrointestinal infection and has the hallmark manifestation of ascending
      flaccid paralysis. We report an atypical presentation of GBS. CASE REPORT A
      76-year-old male presented with acute onset of diaphoresis and altered mental
      status. He subsequently developed severe bradycardia and refractory hypotension, 
      which initially responded to dopamine infusion. A temporary pacemaker wire was
      placed to stabilize the heart rate but hypotension persisted. Acute autonomic
      dysfunction was suspected. Head and chest imaging was unrevealing. Lumbar
      puncture revealed albuminocytologic dissociation that was consistent with a
      diagnosis of GBS. Hospital course was complicated with acute kidney injury and
      metabolic acidosis. Plasmapharesis was initiated. The patient eventually died of 
      multi-organ failure. CONCLUSIONS Autonomic dysfunction is a known but rare
      presentation of GBS. In patients presenting with refractory bradycardia and
      hypotension, GBS should be considered in the differential diagnosis.
