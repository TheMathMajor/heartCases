AB  - We experienced a man in his 20s with inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST)
      initially diagnosed and treated as depression who was steadily treated with
      radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) using an EnSite system. The patient has
      remained well without any symptoms or medications, including antidepressants, for
      two years since the RFCA. To avoid missing IST and treating it as an emotional
      problem and/or mental illness such as depression, physicians - including
      cardiologists - should be aware of these conditions when examining patients with 
      multiple and incapacitating complaints including palpitations and general fatigue
      and/or tachycardia, especially characterized by an elevated resting heart rate or
      a disproportionate increase in the heart rate with minimal exertion.
