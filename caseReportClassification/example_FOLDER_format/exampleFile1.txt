TI  - Azithromycin Causes a Novel Proarrhythmic Syndrome.
LID - e003560 [pii]
LID - 10.1161/CIRCEP.115.003560 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The widely used macrolide antibiotic azithromycin increases risk of
      cardiovascular and sudden cardiac death, although the underlying mechanisms are
      unclear. Case reports, including the one we document here, demonstrate that
      azithromycin can cause rapid, polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in the absence 
      of QT prolongation, indicating a novel proarrhythmic syndrome. We investigated
      the electrophysiological effects of azithromycin in vivo and in vitro using mice,
      cardiomyocytes, and human ion channels heterologously expressed in human
      embryonic kidney (HEK 293) and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. METHODS AND
      RESULTS: In conscious telemetered mice, acute intraperitoneal and oral
      administration of azithromycin caused effects consistent with multi-ion channel
      block, with significant sinus slowing and increased PR, QRS, QT, and QTc
      intervals, as seen with azithromycin overdose. Similarly, in HL-1 cardiomyocytes,
      the drug slowed sinus automaticity, reduced phase 0 upstroke slope, and prolonged
      action potential duration. Acute exposure to azithromycin reduced peak SCN5A
      currents in HEK cells (IC50=110+/-3 mumol/L) and Na+ current in mouse ventricular
      myocytes. However, with chronic (24 hour) exposure, azithromycin caused a
      approximately 2-fold increase in both peak and late SCN5A currents, with findings
      confirmed for INa in cardiomyocytes. Mild block occurred for K+ currents
      representing IKr (CHO cells expressing hERG; IC50=219+/-21 mumol/L) and IKs (CHO 
      cells expressing KCNQ1+KCNE1; IC50=184+/-12 mumol/L), whereas azithromycin
      suppressed L-type Ca++ currents (rabbit ventricular myocytes, IC50=66.5+/-4
      mumol/L) and IK1 (HEK cells expressing Kir2.1, IC50=44+/-3 mumol/L). CONCLUSIONS:
      Chronic exposure to azithromycin increases cardiac Na+ current to promote
      intracellular Na+ loading, providing a potential mechanistic basis for the novel 
      form of proarrhythmia seen with this macrolide antibiotic.
