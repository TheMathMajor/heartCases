TI  - Treatment of supraventricular tachycardia in a horse.
LID - 10.1111/vec.12591 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the treatment of persistent supraventricular tachycardia
      (SVT) in a young horse in endurance training. CASE SUMMARY: A 6-year-old Arab
      gelding in endurance training presented for a dysrhythmia and decreased
      performance. SVT was diagnosed and conversion to a normal sinus rhythm was
      achieved following administration of a constant rate infusion of amiodarone.
      However, reversion to SVT occurred shortly after initiation of ridden exercise. A
      second attempt to convert the dysrhythmia with amiodarone failed, but normal
      sinus rhythm was achieved with transvenous electrical cardioversion (TVEC).
      Postmortem examination of the heart revealed extensive fibrous replacement of
      most of the left atrial myocardium; these changes likely provided the structural 
      substrate for the dysrhythmia. The underlying cause of the fibrosis was not
      identified. NEW OR UNIQUE INFORMATION PROVIDED: SVT is a form of supraventricular
      tachyarrhythmia rarely diagnosed in the horse. A recent report has described
      sudden death of a horse following attempted conversion of SVT with oral
      flecainide acetate. In the present report, we describe short-term conversion of
      SVT in a horse using intravenous amiodarone with no significant adverse effects. 
      When the dysrhythmia recurred, the animal was donated for teaching purposes and
      conversion was achieved with TVEC. Normal sinus rhythm persisted for 2 weeks
      until the horse was euthanized for postmortem evaluation of the heart.
      Intravenous amiodarone or TVEC could be considered as treatments for
      supraventricular tachyarrhyhmias other than atrial fibrillation in the horse.
