'''
heartCases is a medical language processing system for case reports 
involving cardiovascular disease (CVD).

This part of the system is intended for parsing MEDLINE format files 
and specifically isolating those relevant to CVD using terms in titles 
and in MeSH terms.

Requires bokeh, numpy, nltk, and sklearn.

Uses the Disease Ontology project, the 2017 MeSH Ontology,
and the 2017 SPECIALIST Lexicon. 
The SPECIALIST tools come with their own terms and conditions: see
SPECIALIST.txt.
