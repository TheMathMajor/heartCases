'''
heartCases is a medical language processing system for case reports 
involving cardiovascular disease (CVD).

This part of the system is intended for parsing MEDLINE format files 
and specifically isolating those relevant to CVD using terms in titles 
and in MeSH terms.

Requires bokeh, numpy, nltk, and sklearn.

Uses the Disease Ontology project, the 2017 MeSH Ontology,
and the 2017 SPECIALIST Lexicon. 
The SPECIALIST tools come with their own terms and conditions: see
SPECIALIST.txt.

'''
File contains sets of codes to include as MeSH terms used to 
search documents with. Each set (actually a dict) is topic-specific.
These topics are also used to train label expansion classifier(s).
e.g. a heading of C14 and codes of 240 and 280 will include all
terms under C14 (Cardiovascular Diseases) and two of the subheadings.
Subheadings may be more specific: e.g. use 907.253.535 rather than 907
to select only that subheading.

To specify individual search terms rather than topics, see the
--terms argument.

Here, the all_cardiovascular term set is the default topic.
See topic_headings.txt for others.
